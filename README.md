# SomeThinQ

This repository contains the altered Bloquade jupyter notebooks used to make probability plots of different incident neutral atom geometries to see quantum scar revival times.

SQUARE_3_QuERA_ipnyb_pulled_from_Bloqade_tutorials.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook that modifies the Bloqade quantum scarring tutorial in order to run on a square matrix. The number of qubits in the square matrix can be adjusted in the notebook. THe notebook plots a probability distribution graph and returns a pandas table of Rydberg densities.
